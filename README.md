# Flappy Py

Personal project for Introduction to Python Programming course at Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski.

Flappy Py is a desktop game written in Python based on the very popular mobile game Flappy Bird from years ago with a few extra features to make the game even more interesting (or maybe even more annoying) for the user.

## Features

- different enemies coming from the opposite side (hedgehogs because you know what they eat);
- speeding up and slowing down the movement;
- growing and shrinking the size of the player;
- local leaderboard showing the top 10 results;
- changing player's name;
- skin selection for the snake;
- different levels of difficulty (changing the default movement speed).

## Technologies

- Python 3.10.8
- pygame 2.1.2

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```
